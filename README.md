# mips32
mips32 disassembler and maybe emulator at some point 


included intro.pxe ( a PSX intro from Hitmen )

there are nicer ways to write a disassembler but this is intended to be used as an emulator also which is why the code is structured in a more verbose manner. 

# building 
```make``` 

# running

```m32_disasm intro.pxe output.s```

# todo
Allocate buffer for file vs hard coded.

Emulator!
